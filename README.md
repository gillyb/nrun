nrun

Nice script runner for node packages.
I got sick of looking in the `package.json` file of various libraries, including my own, so
I created this script.

After you install it globally, you can run it in any nodejs project directory, and it will show you
a menu with the commands available to you.

On my machine, I aliased the library name to `nr` (short for 'npm run') so this is what it looks like:

Install (globally) with:  
```
npm install -g @gillyb/nrun
```

Contributions are welcome.
Have fun :)
